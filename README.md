This is a simple Q & A form that I created within a day for a software development position. The task was to create an app that will allow a user to create a series of questions that can bet sortable and editable. The user can create a new question by clicking the 'Add Question' button in the upper right-hand corner. Once the question is created, you can edit the card by selecting it's 'Edit' button. This will show a drop down of the card for the user to update the question for the card and the multiple choice answers that are associated with it. If the user needs to re-order the cards, they can simply drag and drop them into the position that they need it to be.
